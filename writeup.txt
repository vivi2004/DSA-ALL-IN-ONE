Write-Up for Graph Centrality Analysis:
    
    - The graph was created by first generating a random spanning tree using the Prufer sequence method,
      then adding extra random edges to enrich the graph.
    - Computed three centrality measures:
         • Normalized Degree Centrality.
         • Closeness Centrality.
         • Betweenness Centrality.
    - Combined the measures using a weighted sum with an extra fine-tuning factor that rewards nodes connected to highly central nodes.
    - Highlighted the top 10 nodes in the visualization.
